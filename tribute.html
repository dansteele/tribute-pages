        <p>Kapustin studied piano with Avrelian Rubakh and subsequently with Alexander Goldenweiser at the Moscow Conservatory. Kapustin acquired a reputation as a jazz pianist, arranger and composer in the 1950's.</p>
        <p>Almost all his compositions are for piano. However, he has written 20 piano sonatas, six piano concerti, and other compositions for ensembles such as five saxophones and an orchestra (Op. 22) and a concerto for double-bass (Op. 76).</p>
        <h4>Kapustin's style is a fusion of classical virtuoso pianism and improvisational jazz. </h4>

      <blockquote><i>"I was never a jazz musician. I never tried to be a real jazz pianist, but I had to do it because of the composing. I'm not interested in improvisation â€“ and what is a jazz musician without improvisation? All my improvisation is written, of course,
        and they became much better; it improved them."</i> - Nikolai Kapustin</blockquote>
